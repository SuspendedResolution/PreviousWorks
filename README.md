# The works done in this repository are all of my previous works I've done throughout my degree. 
# I understand that it is not much, but it is what I have completed in the past 22 months. 
# As I stated in my application I made a career change to CS with a focus in IT not terribly long ago so I am still progressing.
# Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of intricate works to show for it, but I am interested in learning, growing, and helping.
